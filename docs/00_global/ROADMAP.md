# Project Roadmap

## Milestone 1: Documentation & Workflow Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Initialize repository structure.
- [x] Document HMAS workflow.
- [x] Create initial prompt kits.

## Milestone 2: Toolkit Implementation (Completed)
- [x] Refine system prompts (Pull-Based Model).
- [x] Implement automation scripts (`tools/`).
- [x] Finalize Toolkit Documentation (`tools/README.md`).
- [x] Establish Bridge Layer protocols.

## Milestone 3: Real-world Application (Completed)
- [x] Apply HMAS to a target project (The Pilot).
- [x] Evaluate effectiveness and refine protocols.
- [x] Create a "Demo Feature" to showcase the workflow in action.

## Milestone 4: The Inception Engine (Completed)
- [x] Implement autonomous project bootstrapping (`ingest_brief.py`).
- [x] Implement continuous milestone progression (`fetch_next.py`).
- [x] Create master bootloader script (`hmas_boot.sh`).

## Milestone 5: Bridge Layer & Context Continuity (Completed)
- [x] Activate `ask_lead` (Remove stubs).
- [x] Implement "Session Handoff" protocol.
- [x] Refine context aggregation for long-running tasks.

## Milestone 6: Neural Link & Infinity Loop (Completed)
- [x] **The Brain:** Gemini API integration for automated Lead DEV responses.
- [x] **The Heartbeat:** Infinity Loop script (`hmas_loop.sh`) for session auto-restart.
- [x] **The Protocol:** Command Macros (`>> STATUS`, `>> DONE`, `>> BLOCK`, `>> ASK`, `>> HANDOFF`).
- [x] **The Pilot:** End-to-end validation of Neural Link workflow.
